            <span style = "font-size: 14pt;">
          From the competitive analysis, we realized that there are a lot of
           job/internship posting platforms; <strong>however, there is a limited
           number of apps that provides opportunities for users to build
           hand-on work experience and enrich career related skills. </strong>
<br><br>
           For those online courses, programs and/or forums that help people
            gain hand-on experience by working together in groups, they are
             <strong>not really effective at helping people to connect</strong> and <strong>lack important
              features that support group-work such as collaborative workspace.</strong>
<br><br>
              <strong><span style = "color: #534694;"> Hence we want
               to create an app that dedicates to helping users to connect with
               others to work on hand-on projects.</span></span></strong>

      <h3>Constraints & Assumptions</h3>


     <p style = "font-kerning: 5%; max-width:49%;">We hoped to learn from recruiters and their experience with the
        hiring process during the pandemic to understand the problems
        from both perspectives. However, due to the constraint of time
        and resource, we were not able to interview any real recruiters
        nor we could get into contact with the UCSD career center.
        Instead, we relied on online resources and our assumptions based
        upon past interactions to create a fictional persona for the
        recruiters of the company. </p>



    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
      <h3>Persona</h3>

        <div class = "center">
          <img src= "bluum/persona.png" alt = "persona" width = "73%">
        </div>

        <p style = "font-size:12pt; color: #8C8C8C; line-height: 30px; width:67%;">From<a href= "https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephliu/2020/04/20/recruiters-share-9-mistakes-job-seekers-are-making-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic/#7aba537dccbaFrom">
          this articles written by Joseph Liu for Forbes</a>, filtering out
          the unqualified application would be helpful for recruiters to find
          the best candidate efficiently. Recruiters still want to see people
          being proactive and doing things relevant to their line of work. </p>
        <p style = "font-size:12pt; color: #8C8C8C; line-height: 30px; width:67%;">From<a href= "https://www.ere.net/recruiting-in-a-pandemic-a-conversation-with-robin-schooling/">
          this video by Vadim Liberman& Robin Schooloing</a>, This also
          implies making connections with professionals will significantly
          increase the chance of getting hired. Recruiters also recommend
          candidates should expand their skills interdisciplinarily for the
          future, not only within their major but also in other fields in
          order to be more competitive.</p>


      <h3>Storyboard</h3>
      <br>
          <p style = "max-width:49%">Based on the design opportunities, we ideated several “how might we...”
            questions and each came up with a storyboard. We then conducted 5 interviews to understand:</p>
          <br>
              <ul>
                 <li>What do users like/dislike about each storyboard</li>
                 <li style = "max-width:49%">Do they understand each section(context, problem, solution,
                 resolution) of each storyboard</li>
                 <li >Do they see any issues for the solution and What can be improved</li>
                 <li style = "max-width:49%">And overall, which storyboard they are most related to and which
                solution they would personally use or recommend to a friend</li>
              </ul>

      </div>
<br><br>
      <p style = "max-width:49%"> Storyboard 1 got most upvoted (4 out of 5) because the problem was very
         relatable and the solution provided an unique angle to solve the problem.
         However, feedback also suggested that the solution might be too ideal
         and vague concerning how users of the app can get internships through
         completing the project. </p>

  <h3>Improvement</h3>

  <p style = "max-width:49%">Overall, we presented twice to peers and instructional
  crews: One for the user research part and the second time for the whole project.
  Therefore, we got major formal feedback twice and all of which were all very positive: </p>

  </div>

<br><br>


    <p style = "max-width:49%">As mentioned in the constraints section, due to limited time and
    resources, we were not able to gather as much user research as we wanted.
    Therefore, a major improvement would be to perform more
     in-depth user research covering broader potential target users (recruiters and students) of the
     app and increase sample size to optimize the population sampling and
     avoid potential biased dataset</p>

    <p style = "width: 49%;">
     Along the way, our project has received feedback on how related
     the concepts are to the current situation and they will definitely use
     the app like this to connect with others and start their own projects.

     It makes me realize that it's pivotal to anchor the most urgent problem
     in the first place for the following design to work. For instance,
     in the survey response, we also got many responses concerning respondants' emotional
     states and it turned out that many groups had explored the idea of relaxing and alleviating mental stress.
     But we studied deeper and figured <strong>the root causes</strong> that people were anxious
     and unmotivated because of the cancellation of their internships, the layoffs/ freezing hiring process of companies,
     and that they feel unqualified due to lack of connections and experience.
     With those root causes in mind, we divergently thought of solutions from different stages including
     improving skills, getting connections, and applying for jobs. Taking advantage of spotting the right problem and
     ideating various ideas, our project stands out.</p>
